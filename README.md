The scripts use cogent (http://www.vislab.ucl.ac.uk/cogent.php) rather than Psychtoobox to display stimuli etc. You may need to alter the code so that it runs in psychtoolbox if that is what you generally use (or download cogent but I think that cogent *may* only run with PCs (not macs). 
The script that runs the actual experiment is called PE_task. 
The stimuli used here are well distributed I believe (but please check this - they should have a mean/median of 40 and be normally distributed). 
The scripts have some code that allows various post analysis ratings to be collected as part of the experiment (i.e. from matlab). You can tweak these to add/remove measures as you see fit.
